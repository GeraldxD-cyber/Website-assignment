<h1>My reason for choosing Computer Engineering</h1>
 <p>Back then when i was a toddler, i dreamt of being a doctor just like almost every kid. But then as time went on,
    i realized that the world is moving into an era full of technology so i decided to "hop on the trend" by 
    engaging in anything computer or software related. Which led me to choosing Computer Engineering.</p>
